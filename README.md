# WordPress enumeration check

This is a simple [web App](https://jtrollia.github.io/wp-enumeration-check/) that you can use to check if a website is leaking users' information. It isn't 100% accurate as it only works with the most recent versions of WP, that integrates the REST API. The goal is to raise awarness around a common issue that is easy to fix.

A tool like [WPScan](https://wpscan.org/) generates deeper and more reliable analysis.
